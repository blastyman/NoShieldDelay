# No Shield Delay

This plugin was made with the intent to reduce shield delay without making shields broken for lower ping players.

## How to use
* /shield maxdelay - Sets the maximum shield delay.
* /shield mindelay - Sets the minimum shield delay.

Although the option is given to customise both values, the default settings should do the job fine without needing to tweak anything.
